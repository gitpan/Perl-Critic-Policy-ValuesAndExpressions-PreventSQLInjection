=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::PreventSQLInjection - Prevent SQL injection in interpolated strings.


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.0.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.0.1';


=head1 AFFILIATION

This is a standalone policy not part of a larger PerlCritic Policies group.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

When building SQL statements manually instead of using an ORM, any input must
be quoted or passed using placeholders to prevent the introduction of SQL
injection vectors. This policy attempts to detect the most common sources of
SQL injection in manually crafted SQL statements, by detecting the use of
variables inside interpolated strings that look like SQL statements.

In other words, this policy searches for code such as:

	my $sql = "SELECT * FROM $table WHERE field = $value";

But would leave alone:

	my $string = "Hello $world";


=head1 CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration option available for this policy.


=head1 MARKING VARIABLES AS SAFE

You can disable this policy on a particular string with the usual PerlCritic
syntax:

	my $sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = $value"; ## no critic (PreventSQLInjection)

This is however not recommended, even if you know that $value is safe because
it was previously quoted with something such as:

	my $value = $dbh->quote( $user_value );

The risk there is that someone will later modify your code and introduce unsafe
variables by accident, which will then not get reported. To prevent this, this
module has a special C<## SQL safe ($var1, $var2, ...)> syntax which allows
whitelisting specific variables:

	my $sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = $value"; ## SQL safe($value)

That said, you should always convert your code to use placeholders instead
where possible.


=head1 LIMITATIONS

There are B<many> sources of SQL injection flaws, and this module comes with no guarantee whatsoever. It focuses on the most obvious flaws, but you should still learn more about SQL injection techniques to manually detect more advanced issues.

Possible future improvements for this module:

=item * Detect concatenation

Currently, this module only analyzes whole strings, and ignores concatenated strings or variables. For example, this would incorrectly not trigger a violation:

	my $sql = 'SELECT * FROM ' . $table;

=item * Detect use of sprintf()

This should probably be considered a violation:

	my $sql = sprintf(
		'SELECT * FROM %s',
		$table
	);

=item * Parse heredoc

This module does not analyze heredoc, but should since it interpolates variables by default.
